## Brief Introduction to L-systems
Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) are a string-rewriting process. They use a set of rules to recursively modify a string of symbols, transforming the initial string into something more complex. They are often applied in computer graphics, where they can be used to generate models of fractals and plants. 

### DOL-systems
The simplest type of L-system is a DOL-system. They are deterministic (there is exactly one way to transform each letter) and context-free (symbols from the preceding string are rewritten regardless of their position). 

To better understand this system, consider this string of characters (symbols): 
<p align="center">AB+A</p>

This initial string is known as the axiom, where each letter corresponds to a rewriting rule. In this case, let the rules be:
<p align="center">
  A → A-B
  <br/>
  B → AB
</p>

After three iterations of this system, AB+A would be rewritten as the following:
| Iteration | String                                |
| :-------: |:-------------------------------------:|
| 1         | A-BAB+A-B                             |
| 2         | A-B-ABA-BAB+A-B-AB                    |
| 3         | A-B-AB-A-BABA-B-ABA-BAB+A-B-AB-A-BAB  |

### Drawing L-systems 
By defining each symbol with an action, L-systems can be graphed. In particular, this project uses Python turtle graphics to draw two DOL-systems. Both use symbols with the following geometric interpretations:
| Symbol             | Command                                                                  |
| :----------------: |:------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| F                  | Move forward by drawing a line of a specified length                     |
| A-Z (excluding F)  | Do nothing                                                               |
| +                  | Turn right by a specified degree                                         |
| -                  | Turn left by a specified degree                                          |
| \[                 | Push the current position and direction of the pen/turtle onto a stack   |
| \]                 | Pop the previous position and direction of the pen/turtle from a stack   |

## Setup 
### For Linux
If Python has not been previously installed, run the following:
```
$ sudo apt install python3.9
$ python3.9 --version
```

### For MacOS
If Homebrew has not been previously installed, follow the instructions listed [here](https://brew.sh/).

If Python has not been previously installed, run the following:
```
$ brew install python@3.9
$ python3.9 --version
```

### After Installing Initial Requirements
Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/miaisakovic/l-system-drawings.git
``` 
When asked to enter credentials, input your username and personal access token.

## Viewing the L-system Drawings
To view the Sierpiński arrowhead curve, run the following command:
```
$ python3.9 <relative path to sierpinski_arrowhead_curve.py>
```
To view a drawing generated by an L-system (which was provided by [LSystemBot 2.0](https://twitter.com/lsystembot?lang=en)), run the following command:
```
$ python3.9 <relative path to l_system.py>
```
